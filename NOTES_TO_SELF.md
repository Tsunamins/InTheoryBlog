left off in ViewPost and AllPosts
idea will be to consider trying to change ViewPost to class component to get history easier
try View post first, see if I can get history of clicked id to getOnePost and render
info based on this

if that doesn't work do it instead with AllPosts
main goal, render post view and all of its attributes onto the screen
secondary goal, unique way of holding an edited post in redux, but not important

from there, enable edit and delte
